            Hello, my name is Stephanie. I am a visual, hands-on person who enjoys creating and building.
            Technology has always held a special place in my heart so, I have decided to become a developer.
            I am attending We Can Code {IT} bootcamp to help me develop the necessary employable skills. So far, I have
            learned C#, MVC, Object Oriented Programming, HTML and JavaScript.</p>

     <!--   <p>My name is Stephanie Gandy and I am an aspiring developer. With training from We Can Code {IT}, I have developed employable skill to help me achieve my goals.
        I have always had an interest in technology because my family has always kept up with current technologies. My dad has worked on computers as a hobby for years.
        He started teaching me things about DOS and hardware as a young child. I recieved my first computer around '98 for christmas from my grandmother. This allowed me
        discover all the things you could do with a computer such as photo editing and the internet. When I attended college for graphic design, my decision to pick that major
        was based on this and the fact that I loved art. After an internship, I decided that I wasn't being challenged and I wanted to learn more of the programming aspect.
        This would help me to better
